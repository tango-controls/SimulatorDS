This is a simulation suite for PyTango, it allows to create dynamic device servers and replicate existings systems into playable mockups.

To replicate a running system in few minutes see the gen_simulation script: https://github.com/tango-controls/SimulatorDS/blob/master/doc/gen_simulation.rst

To build your own simulations, see the SimulatorDS user guide: https://github.com/tango-controls/SimulatorDS/blob/master/doc/recipes.rst

It requires fandango: https://github.com/tango-controls/fandango
